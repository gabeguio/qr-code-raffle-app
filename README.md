# Conference Scanner

## Overview

The app is meant for sponsors at a tech conference to scan QR codes and keep track of booth visitors. Towards the end of the conference, each sponsor will select a random visitor for a sponsor prize. In addition, towards the end of the event, the conference organizers will select an attendee who has visited every sponsor for a grand prize.

## Technology

### Frontend

- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Webpack, AXIOS

### Backend

- Java, AWS Lambda, DynamoDb

## Notable Dependencies

- The conference uses [Tito Event Management](https://ti.to/developers) to provide QR codes for every attendee. These QR codes will be printed on the attendee's badges to carry around the conference and scan at each booth. The QR codes have embedded information for an attendee's contact information.
- On the front end, the plan is to use an [embedded QR scanner](https://www.webqr.com/index.html) for the sponsors to pull up on their phones to scan attendees.
